<h2>About Me</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Rajeev Kumar is a Professor of Computer Science & Engineering. He holds a Ph.D. degree in Computer 
    Engineering from Univ. Sheffield, an M.Tech. degree in Computer Sc. & Tech. from Univ. Roorkee 
    (now IIT Roorkee), and an M.Sc. degree in Physics (Electronics) from Univ. Allahabad. His primary 
    education was in a river-side Gurukul, Shri Dugdheshwar Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya at Pilibhit. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an academician by choice. He has four decades of experience in teaching & research, which is his 
    lifeline. He served Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) at Kharagpur & Kanpur, Birla Institute of Technology 
    & Science (BITS) Pilani, and JNU New Delhi. Prior to his academic tenure, he worked as a Scientist in the Defence 
    R & D Organization (DRDO) Dehradun and the Department of Science & Technology (DST) Hyderabad/New Delhi. He was a 
    Visiting Design Engineer at National Semiconductors (NSC) Germany. He visited several universities in USA, UK, 
    Germany, Switzerland, Japan, S. Korea, and Singapore.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>R & D:</b> His initial learning at DRDO culminated in technology transformation for end-users. His research interests 
    include higher education, machine learning, medical imaging, multimedia, programming languages, software systems, 
    evolutionary optimization, and scientometrics. He has published over 250 research articles in international journals 
    and conferences, several in lead venues. He has supervised nineteen doctoral, over eighty master theses, and a 
    hundred undergraduate projects. He worked on industrial-funded projects from Microsoft USA and NSC USA; the NSC 
    project was in close collaboration with their USA, Germany, and Israel units. He founded the Data to Knowledge 
    (D2K) Lab at JNU. He is a reviewer for journal/conference papers. He delivered several keynote & invited lectures 
    and tutorials at conferences. His h-index on Google Scholar is 25. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Teaching: </b>Rajeev has designed and taught several Computer Science & Engineering courses ranging from freshman to 
    senior graduate level. He has taught programming (C/C++/C#/Java/R/Python), core and advanced (Data Struct., 
    Algorithms, Compiler, Software Engg, Pattern Classification, Machine Learning), application (Image/Video 
    Processing, Computer Vision, Multimedia Sys.), and specialized courses (Statistics, Evolutionary Comp, Research 
    Method, etc.). At JNU, he introduced the Academic Ethics course. His teaching focuses on active learning, thinking, 
    creativity, and innovation with flexible workloads/assessments.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Academic Leadership:</b> He served as a Senator in IITs Kharagpur/Kanpur and BITS, a member of the Court and Academic 
    Council in JNU, and several other academic bodies, e.g., Board of Studies, Statutory Comm. of Institutes/Universities. 
    He worked for reforms in curriculum, academic structure, regulations, and ordinances. He mostly worked as a crisis 
    handler with out-of-box solutions for complex problems.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Public Policy:</b> His contribution to framing public policies for higher education is enormous. He reformed IITs admission 
    examinations, bringing transparency and accuracy through well-defined processes. He pioneered common examination 
    and common counseling (JoSAA/CSAB) for admissions in IITs/NITs/ IIITs/CFTIs. Almost all admissions & competitive 
    examinations of the country in most disciplines have been reformed following this model. His proposal for an independent 
    body led to the setting of the National Testing Agency (NTA). Including common examinations in NEP 2020 is a testimony 
    of his work, leading to CUETs in Central Universities. His prototype for common counseling in CUs developed with the 
    Ministry will be used fin 2024. He advocated for the Research Advisory Comm. (RAC) and Ethics course for PhD Students in 
    JNU; UGC adopted both. Recently, IITs adopted several measures from his proposal for preventing suicides. India's Hon'ble 
    Supreme Court hailed him as one of the many unsung heroes who helped in improving the system.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He defined quantitative Academic Performance Indices (APIs) in 2009. He co-authored/authored output-based quantifiable 
    ABET-guided accreditation guidelines for undergraduate engineering programs from 2009 to 2011. These have been in public use 
    since 2011, making the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) an autonomous body. This work led India to join the Washington Accord 
    in June 2014 permanently. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His four decades of academic/administrative expertise acquired across universities and institutions in India and abroad have enriched his 
    passion for teaching, research, curriculum development, faculty mentoring, and institution building. His reform-centric & student-oriented 
    leadership, combined with 24/7 work ethics, open comm., legal acumen, and wider perception across inst./univ., is an asset.</p>
